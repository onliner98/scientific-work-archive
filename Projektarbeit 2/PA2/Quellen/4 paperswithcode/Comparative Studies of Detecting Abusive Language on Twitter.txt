Introduction:
- comparing different Models for twitter text categorization
Neural Network based Models
- KimCNN (Kim 2014)
- HybridCNN (Park anf Fung 2017)
- biRNN with GRUs (Schuster and Paliwal 1997, Cho et al 2014)
- biRNN with self Attention (Wang et al)
- w/context meanst that not only the tweet itself is used as input but also the context of the tweet (e.g. a referenced tweet or a tweet replyed to)
