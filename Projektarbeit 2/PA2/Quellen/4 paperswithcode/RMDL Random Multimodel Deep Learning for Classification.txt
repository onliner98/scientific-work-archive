Introduction:
- typical structures: DNN, RNN, CNN
Rel Work
- this Model uses Glove
- CNN for text classification [21]
Method: Random Multimodal Deep Learning (RDL)
- randomly create d DNNs r RNNs and c CNNs, each one is randomly created (reagarding hyper params)
- train all n Models in parallel
- final prediction is calculated using majority vote
Experiment
- vlg CNN RNN and RDL, RDL gewinnt je mehr Random Models es hat
