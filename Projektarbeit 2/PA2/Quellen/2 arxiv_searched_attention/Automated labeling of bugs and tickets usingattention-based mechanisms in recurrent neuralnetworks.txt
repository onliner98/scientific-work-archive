Introduction
- Bigger CLassification Tasks Yelp, IMDB Amazon ... have low accuracies areound 60%
Existing Methods
- Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF + SVM
- Wordembedding + RNN
- DeepTriage: biLSTM+Attention followed by 2 fully connected layers
Proposed Approach
- preprocessing: everything to lowercase, remove stopwords, filter garbage with a regex
- hierachical attention:
  - Inpute: BiLSTM+Attention to Encode each Sentence in a document out of words(embedded)
  - On Top: BiLSTM+Attention to Encode the document from all encoded sentences
- Network architecture
  - Deep Attention Block: GRU-64 >> Dropout >> GRU-32 >> Dropout >> Dense >> Attention
  - Hierachical structure: 
    - WordEmbeddings >> DeepAttentionBlock (this produces a sentence embedding)
    - SentenceEmbeddings >> DeepAttentionBlock (this produces a document embedding)
    - documentEmbedding >> Softmax
Comparative Benchmark
- Table 3: With 16 classes F1 Score of 56% is acchieved, rather equal to DeepTriage
