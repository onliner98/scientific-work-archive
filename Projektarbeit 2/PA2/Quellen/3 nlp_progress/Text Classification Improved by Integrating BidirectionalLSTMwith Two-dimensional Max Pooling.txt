Model: BLSTM-2DCNN
- BLSTM Layer: takes in xt and produces Vector ht
  - Input: sequence of GloVe Vectors x1..xl
- 2D CNN: takes in H and produces Matrix O
  - Input: Matrix H of the sequence of hiddenstates ht
- 2D Max Pooling: takes in O and produces Vector a Matrix which is rearrange to a vector
- Outputlayer: Softmax(W h* + b)
