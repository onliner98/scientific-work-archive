Tests for text classification:
- DenseNet CNNs (word and character Level)
- CNNs (word and character Level)
- LSTM
Conclusion
- shallow(flach) CNNs on word level perform best
- deep CNNs on character level perform better than shallow ones
- it remains unclear whether deep or shallow models are better
