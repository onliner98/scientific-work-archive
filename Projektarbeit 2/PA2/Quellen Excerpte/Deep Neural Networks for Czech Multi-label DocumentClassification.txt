Abstracts: 
- NNs perform better on document classification than statistical methods, CNNs performed best
Intro:
- NNs work better than feature engineering approachesin several NLP fields (mit Beleg)
NN Doc classification
- Feedforward Deep Neural Network with Bag Of Words (Dictionary Vector where 1 means word is in document 0 word is not)
- Dictonary takes only the N frequent words
- Convolutional Neural Network with fixed size sequence of Wordvectors (unknowns and padding each have an own vektor) => padding and truncating of documents
- Achieved better results with 1D Kernels than with 2D
- 37 Classes
Experiment
- 37 classes around 11.000 documents
- few tests for hyperparams => Results with best hyperparams are Taken see conclusion
Conclusion:
- F1 Score 
  - CNN: 84.7 
  - FNN:83.9
- Man könnte pretrrained Vectorembedding nutzen anstatt es zu lernen (Glove, Word2Vec)
