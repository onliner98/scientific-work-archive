Introduction
-Text Classification: CNNs are better or equal to LSTM
  - Vanishing Gradient Problem in CNN [20,21]
  - Solution: Highway CNNs
- Word embeddings improve the classification accuracy
  - e.G. Wor2Vec and Glove [24-26]
  - need very larg datasets to be trained [27,28] => use pretrained ones
  - are not best fit for the data of specific tasks [1,29-33]
- This paper tests 
  - multiple block convolutional networks 
  - highway networks [22]
  - dense nets [18]
  - batch normalization [37]
  - bottleneck layers [36,38]
  - Improved Word Vectors to cope with above mentioned problems
Related Work
- Word Embeddings
- CNNs
- HIghway Networks
- alle 3 jeweils mit Anwendungsbeispielen
Proposed Architecture
- Improved Word Vector: Concatination of word2vec/glove + lexicon2vec(sentiment representation) + pos2vec(position in sentence)
- Model: siehe figure 2
