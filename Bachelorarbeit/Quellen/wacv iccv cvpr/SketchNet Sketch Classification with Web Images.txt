Classification of Sketches 
=> Special Learning Objective: instead of directly predicting the class give the network a real image of the class, a real image of another class and a sketch
=> Architecture training: 3 CNNs (real img from class, sketch, real img other class) merged by CNN => Predict with 2 Loss
=> Architecture predicting: Merged the training layers => CNN

Compared Models: SketchNet, AlexNet[20], GoogLeNet[32], NIN [23], VGGNet [5]

SkethNet wins for this tasks (but is specifically designed for this task)
