Use Tree Structure for Classification
1st Network Groups InputData in Clusters = Root Node
Each Cluster is Handeled by another Network = nth Node
							     /-> ...
	     /-> Cluster 1 -> 2nd node Network for Cluster 1 --> ...
x->root Node --> Cluster 2 -> ...			     \-> ...
	     \-> Cluster 3 -> ...

This Paper uses:
- NiN for Root Node
- MLP for nth Node

Compared Networks: NiN[15], DSN[14], CNN
