This paper builds upon the state of the art of image classification to determine the best-performing neural network for tool image classification. The neural network is determined in the course of an experiment. The methodology of this paper, i.e., metric determination, experiment design, and literature review follows, common practice. The metric for the experiment is chosen based on the metrics used by image classification leaderboards, see Section \ref{sec:metric}. The experiment is designed based on state-of-the-art experiments for tool image classification, see Section \ref{sec:experiment}. The state of the art is analyzed in the course of a literature review following the methodology of \cite{Webster.2002}, see Section \ref{sec:litrev}.

In the course of the literature review conducted by this paper, no paper about neural tool image classification was found. To the best of the knowledge of this paper, this paper is the first paper to examine neural classification of tool images. The practical implications of this are presented in Section \ref{sec:practical}.
