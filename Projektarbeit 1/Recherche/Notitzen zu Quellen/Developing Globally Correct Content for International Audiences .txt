Questions that the project managers/devs need to ask for content:
- How fluent is the target audience in the language?
- Should translators be included as devs?
- Do translators need content knowledge (technical terminology/concepts)?
- Are Multilingual team members/instructors/documents required
- Are translators required ruring meetings/trainings?
- How much are time, personnel and cost needed for each translated version?
- What conventions should be included in the documentation to express distance, date, temperature, time, speed, and other international differences?
- In what languages are materials legally required to be? E.G.: In Canada materials must be French and English.
- How accessible do your materials need to be for special-needs audiences? E.G.Will multilingual sign language professionals be  required in a  training class?
Guidlines for writing clearly:
- Do not leave out knowledge that seems trivial, that would cause confusion for audience that is not so technically competent
- Use modifiers(1-n words that specifie another word) with an unambigious relation to which word they modifie.
- Use Words with only one meaning
- Use conjunctuis in a way they clearly indicate relationship (the same conjunction several times in a sentence may cause confusion)
- Use articel(the a), pronouns(that which ...), cojunctions(and as ...)
- Use short sentences
- Explan or avoid symbols, abbreviations, and  non-standard industry acronyms.
- Define jargon terms and aooed a glossary to your documentation
Conventions to consider include: 
- Distance: mile or kilometer, foot or meter, inch or centimeter 
- Speed: miles per hour or kilometers per hour 
- Weight: pound, kilogram, or stone 
- Temperature: Celsius or Fahrenheit or Kelvin
- Time: 24-hour notation or a.m./p.m. 
- Date: day/month/year or month/day/year 
Frames of reference:
- What is the geographic, national,  racial, religious, cultural, or whatever perspective. E.g. Does "next summer" mean July or December?
