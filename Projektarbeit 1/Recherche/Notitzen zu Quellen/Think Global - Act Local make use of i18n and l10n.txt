Actual localization process may include:
    translation
    Adapting graphs to target market needs
    Modifying content to suit different tastes and consumer habits of the target market
    Adapting design and layout to display translated text properly
    Converting to local requirements (currencies, measurement units)
    Adapting to proper local formats for dates, addresses, etc.
    Respecting and applying local regulations and legal rules
    Adapting cultural nuances
