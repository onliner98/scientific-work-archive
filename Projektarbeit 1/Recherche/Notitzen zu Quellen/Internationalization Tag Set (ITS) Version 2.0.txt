[Abstract]
ITS 2.0 focuses on HTML, XML-based formats in general, and can leverage processing based on the XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF)
[2.1 Data Categories] Data categories define the information ITS can convey
- Translate: Expresses if content is intended for translation
- Localization Note: Notes for localizers about content of an item
- Terminology: Infos about a term e.g. link term database, definition
- Directionality: specifies writing direction
- Language Information: Language of a given content
- Elements within text: How content is related to the textflow (e.g. is a paragraph)
- Domain: Topic/Subject of content which is to be translated
- Text Analysis: Lexical or cenceptual information about the context
- Local Filter: Specifies that a content can only be seen by certain locals
- Provenance: Specifies the authors of content
- External Resource: references resources outside the document, that need to be considered for localisation (e.g. images, video)
- Target Pointer: Associates source content (e.g. contetn to be translated) and target (e.g. translated form of the source content)
- Id Value: Unique ID for a content
- Preservev Space: Indicates how whitespace is handeled in content
- Localization Quality Issue: describes nature and severity detected during language oriented QA
- Localization Quality Rating: Measurnment of the localization quality
- MT Confidence: confidence Machine Translation system has about the translation
- Allowed Characters: allowed characters for a piece of content
- Storage size: Max storage for a given piece of content
[2.2 Selection] Select translateable Strings via general rules(XPath/query languages) or directly by attribute. Datacategories are associated with xml/html nodes(element/attribute). ITS 2.0 enables Defaults and inheritance
[2.2.1 Local Approach] The its:translate attribute with value="no" marks the corresponding element and all its child elements as not considered for translation
The span element, which serves as a carrier for the local ITS attributes
<tag its:translate="no">
  this will not be translated
  <otherTag>
    neither will this be translated
  </otherTag>
  nor that
</tag>
[2.2.2 Global Approach] The <its:rules> element contains one or more child elements e.g. <its:translateRule> 
each child element has a selector attribute with XPath or absolute location paths as value.
The selector attribute specifies nodes(xml tags) to wich the information given by the tag of the selector is applied
The rules element should be placed where it does not impact the structure of the document, e.g., in a “head”

</myTopic>
[2.3 Overriding, Inheritance and Defaults]How this works is explained using an example
- The ITS default is that all elements are translatable.
- The translateRule element declared in the header overrides the default for the head element inside text and for all its children.
- Because the title element is actually translatable, the global rule needs to be overridden by a local its:translate="yes".
- In the body of the document the default applies, and its:translate="no" is used to set "faux pas" as non-translatable.

[2.4 Adding Information or Pointing to Existing Information] Data categories can add information or point to information for the selected nodes. Pointing and adding is mutually exclusive
[2.6 Traceability] Die 5.7 ITS Tools Annotation ermöglicht informationen darüber festzuhalten woher daten kommen(z.b. von welcher anwendung)
[3 Notation and Terminology]
The Namespace for ITS MUST be used it is:
<root xmlns:its="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its"...
[4.1 Conformance Type 1: ITS Markup Declarations]
1) At least one of the following MUST be in the schema:
  A) rules element
  B) one of the local ITS attributes
  C) span element
2) If the rules element is used, it MUST be part of the content model of at least one element declared in the schema. It SHOULD be in a content model for meta information, if this is available in that schema (e.g., the head element in [XHTML 1.0]).
3) If the span element is used, it SHOULD be declared as an inline element.
[4.2 Conformance Type 2: The Processing Expectations for ITS Markup]
1) A processor MUST implement at least one data category. For each implemented data category, the following MUST be taken into account:
  A) processing of at least one selection mechanism (global or local).
  B) the default selections for the data category.
  C) the precedence definitions for selections defined in Section 5.5: Precedence between Selections, for the type of selections it processes.
2) If an application claims to process ITS markup for the global selection mechanism, it MUST process an XLink href attribute found on a rules element.
3) If an application claims to process ITS markup implementing the conformance clauses 2-2 and 2-3, it MUST process that markup with XML documents.
4) Non-ITS elements and attributes found in ITS elements MAY be ignored.
5.1 Indicating the Version of ITS
- The current its version is "2.0"
- The version attribute MUST be in the rules element without a prefix.
- The version attribute MUST be provided in an element where its markup is used or in one of its ancestors
- Ther MUST NOT be different versions of ITS in the same document, external linked rules can have different versions
[5.3 Query Language of Selectors]
query language is set by queryLanguage attribute on rules element. If queryLanguge is not specified XPath 1.0 is used as a default query language.
For Additional Info on XPATH see Notitze zu XPATH im selben ORdner wie dieses Dokument
[5.4 Link to External Rules]
- Associate external ITS Rules using XLink [XLink 1.1] href attribute in the rules element.
- The referenced document MUST be a valid XML document, containing min. one rules element located anywhere (root or properly nested)
<its:rules version="2.0" xmlns:its="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="EX-link-external-rules-1.xml">
  <its:translateRule selector="//term" translate="yes"/>
</its:rules>
[5.7 ITS Tools Annotation] ITS provides mark up to associate data with information about the processor that generated them.

indicated by mylangattribute, which is attached to the p elements, and expresses language using values conformant to [BCP47].
