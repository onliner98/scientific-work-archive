"most successful avenue for securing localization support"[...][is] using Translation Management System (TMS) [...] [to] increased efficiency

FÜR MEINEN AUSBLICK:
Erweiterung des Datenformats um es für Data driven decision makeing anzupassen might be considered aswell z.b. für extent of localiazation (eol: wie tiefgründig soll die lokalisierung sein)
[Summary]
"The localization industry is no exception when it comes to the reliance on data for decision making. 
Increasingly, localization managers are required to substantiate requests for budget and resources with 
real data and must demonstrate ROI of localization using metrics. Bringing all data points together is a 
key step, and having data in a digestible format is critical for the analysis phase."
