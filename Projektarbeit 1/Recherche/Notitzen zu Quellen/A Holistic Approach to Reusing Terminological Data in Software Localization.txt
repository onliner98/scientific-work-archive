Software interface text: SIT

Instead of embedding STIs in your sourcecode outsource them in a resourcefile and let other persons(not devs) take care of those 
=> consistency, simple translation

SITs often are terms => they should be outsourced in a Term Database (like a TM but give unambigious definition and context) instead of a Translation Memory System=>consistent term use

Model for Termdatabase TDB: ISO 16642
