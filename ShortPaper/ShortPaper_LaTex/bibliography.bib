@article{Bejnordi.2017,
 abstract = {Currently, histopathological tissue examination by a pathologist represents the gold standard for breast lesion diagnostics. Automated classification of histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) is challenging owing to the wide range of appearances of benign lesions and the visual similarity of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) to invasive lesions at the cellular level. Consequently, analysis of tissue at high resolutions with a large contextual area is necessary. We present context-aware stacked convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification of breast WSIs into normal/benign, DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We first train a CNN using high pixel resolution to capture cellular level information. The feature responses generated by this model are then fed as input to a second CNN, stacked on top of the first. Training of this stacked architecture with large input patches enables learning of fine-grained (cellular) details and global tissue structures. Our system is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing 221 WSIs of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast tissue specimens. The system achieves an AUC of 0.962 for the binary classification of nonmalignant and malignant slides and obtains a three-class accuracy of 81.3{\%} for classification of WSIs into normal/benign, DCIS, and IDC, demonstrating its potential for routine diagnostics.},

@inproceedings{Belilovsky.2019,
 abstract = {Shallow supervised 1-hidden layer neural networks have a number of favorable properties that make them easier to interpret, analyze, and optimize than their deep counterparts, but lack their representational power. Here we use 1-hidden layer learning problems to sequentially build deep networks layer by layer, which can inherit properties from shallow networks. Contrary to previous approaches using shallow networks, we focus on problems where deep learning is reported as critical for success. We thus study CNNs on image classification tasks using the large-scale ImageNet dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. Using a simple set of ideas for architecture and training we find that solving sequential 1-hidden-layer auxiliary problems lead to a CNN that exceeds AlexNet performance on ImageNet. Extending this training methodology to construct individual layers by solving 2-and-3-hidden layer auxiliary problems, we obtain an 11-layer network that exceeds several members of the VGG model family on ImageNet, and can train a VGG-11 model to the same accuracy as end-to-end learning. To our knowledge, this is the first competitive alternative to end-to-end training of CNNs that can scale to ImageNet. We illustrate several interesting properties of these models and conduct a range of experiments to study the properties this training induces on the intermediate layers.},

Images with random patches removed are presented to a generator whose task is to fill in the hole, based on the surrounding pixels. The in-painted images are then presented to a discriminator network that judges if they are real (unaltered training images) or not. This task acts as a regularizer for standard supervised training of the discriminator. Using our approach we are able to directly train large VGG-style networks in a semi-supervised fashion. We evaluate on STL-10 and PASCAL datasets, where our approach obtains performance comparable or superior to existing methods.},

@article{Esteva.2017,
 abstract = {Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images-two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets-consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

Machine learning techniques have powered many aspects of medical investigation and clinical practice. Recently, deep learning is emerging as a leading machine learning tool in computer vision and has attracted considerable attention in biomedical image analysis. In this paper, we provide a snapshot of this fast-growing field, specifically for microscopy image analysis. We briefly introduce the popular deep neural networks and summarize current deep learning achievements in various tasks, such as detection, segmentation, and classification in microscopy image analysis. In particular, we explain the architectures and the principles of convolutional neural networks, fully convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, stacked autoencoders, and deep belief networks, and interpret their formulations or modelings for specific tasks on various microscopy images. In addition, we discuss the open challenges and the potential trends of future research in microscopy image analysis using deep learning.},

 abstract = {Efficient Human Epithelial-2 cell image classification can facilitate the diagnosis of many autoimmune diseases. This paper proposes an automatic framework for this classification task, by utilizing the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have recently attracted intensive attention in visual recognition. In addition to describing the proposed classification framework, this paper elaborates several interesting observations and findings obtained by our investigation. They include the important factors that impact network design and training, the role of rotation-based data augmentation for cell images, the effectiveness of cell image masks for classification, and the adaptability of the CNN-based classification system across different datasets. Extensive experimental study is conducted to verify the above findings and compares the proposed framework with the well-established image classification models in the literature. The results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that 1) the proposed framework can effectively outperform existing models by properly applying data augmentation, 2) our CNN-based framework has excellent adaptability across different datasets, which is highly desirable for cell image classification under varying laboratory settings. Our system is ranked high in the cell image classification competition hosted by ICPR 2014.},

@article{Gao.2019,
 abstract = {Representing features at multiple scales is of great importance for numerous vision tasks. Recent advances in backbone convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continually demonstrate stronger multi-scale representation ability, leading to consistent performance gains on a wide range of applications. However, most existing methods represent the multi-scale features in a layer-wise manner. In this paper, we propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone CNN models, e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt, and DLA. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models on widely-used datasets, e.g., CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Further ablation studies and experimental results on representative computer vision tasks, i.e., object detection, class activation mapping, and salient object detection, further verify the superiority of the Res2Net over the state-of-the-art baseline methods. The source code and trained models are available on https://mmcheng.net/res2net/.},

 abstract = {We propose \emph{MaxUp}, an embarrassingly simple, highly effective technique for improving the generalization performance of machine learning models, especially deep neural networks. The idea is to generate a set of augmented data with some random perturbations or transforms and minimize the maximum, or worst case loss over the augmented data. By doing so, we implicitly introduce a smoothness or robustness regularization against the random perturbations, and hence improve the generation performance. For example, in the case of Gaussian perturbation,  \emph{MaxUp} is asymptotically equivalent to using the gradient norm of the loss as a penalty to encourage smoothness. We test \emph{MaxUp} on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and adversarial certification, on which \emph{MaxUp} consistently outperforms the existing best baseline methods, without introducing substantial computational overhead. In particular, we improve ImageNet classification from the state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy {\$}85.5\%$ without extra data to {\$}85.8\%$. Code will be released soon.},

@article{Harangi.2018,
 abstract = {Skin cancer is a major public health problem with over 123,000 newly diagnosed cases worldwide in every year. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, responsible for over 9000 deaths in the United States each year. Thus, reliable automatic melanoma screening systems would provide a great help for clinicians to detect the malignant skin lesions as early as possible. In the last five years, the efficiency of deep learning-based methods increased dramatically and their performances seem to outperform conventional image processing methods in classification tasks. However, this type of machine learning-based approaches have a main drawback, namely they require thousands of labeled images per classes for their training. In this paper, we investigate how we can create an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks to improve further their individual accuracies in the task of classifying dermoscopy images into the three classes melanoma, nevus, and seborrheic keratosis when we have no opportunity to train them on adequate number of annotated images. To achieve high classification accuracy, we fuse the outputs of the classification layers of four different deep neural network architectures. More specifically, we propose the aggregation of robust convolutional neural networks (CNNs) into one framework, where the final classification is achieved based on the weighted output of the member CNNs. For aggregation, we consider different fusion-based methods and select the best performing one for this problem. Our experimental results also prove that the creation of an ensemble of different neural networks is a meaningful approach, since each of the applied fusion strategies outperforms the individual networks regarding classification accuracy. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve has been found to be 0.891 for the 3-class classification task. For an objective evaluation of our approach, we have tested its performance on the official test database of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017 challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection dedicated to skin cancer recognition.},

@article{Harris.2020,
 abstract = {Mixed Sample Data Augmentation (MSDA) has received increasing attention in recent years, with many successful variants such as MixUp and CutMix. Following insight on the efficacy of CutMix in particular, we propose FMix, an MSDA that uses binary masks obtained by applying a threshold to low frequency images sampled from Fourier space. FMix improves performance over MixUp and CutMix for a number of state-of-the-art models across a range of data sets and problem settings. We go on to analyse MixUp, CutMix, and FMix from an information theoretic perspective, characterising learned models in terms of how they progressively compress the input with depth. Ultimately, our analyses allow us to decouple two complementary properties of augmentations, and present a unified framework for reasoning about MSDA. Code for all experiments is available at https://github.com/ecs-vlc/FMix.},

@article{He.2015b,
 abstract = {Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g., 224 $\times$ 224) input image. This requirement is {\textquotedbl}artificial{\textquotedbl} and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, {\textquotedbl}spatial pyramid pooling{\textquotedbl}, to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102 $\times$ faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank {\#}2 in object detection and {\#}3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition.},

 abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

@article{Makinen.2008,
 abstract = {We present a systematic study on gender classification with automatically detected and aligned faces. We experimented with 120 combinations of automatic face detection, face alignment and gender classification. One of the findings was that the automatic face alignment methods did not increase the gender classification rates. However, manual alignment increased classification rates a little, which suggests that automatic alignment would be useful when the alignment methods are further improved. We also found that the gender classification methods performed almost equally well with different input image sizes. In any case, the best classification rate was achieved with a support vector machine. A neural network and Adaboost achieved almost as good classification rates as the support vector machine and could be used in applications where classification speed is considered more important than the best possible classification accuracy.},

@article{Rawat.2017,
 abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to visual tasks since the late 1980s. However, despite a few scattered applications, they were dormant until the mid-2000s when developments in computing power and the advent of large amounts of labeled data, supplemented by improved algorithms, contributed to their advancement and brought them to the forefront of a neural network renaissance that has seen rapid progression since 2012. In this review, which focuses on the application of CNNs to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art deep learning systems. Along the way, we analyze (1) their early successes, (2) their role in the deep learning renaissance, (3) selected symbolic works that have contributed to their recent popularity, and (4) several improvement attempts by reviewing contributions and challenges of over 300 publications. We also introduce some of their current trends and remaining challenges.},

@article{Shi.2019,
 abstract = {We develop a fine-grained image classifier using a general deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). We improve the fine-grained image classification accuracy of a DCNN model from the following two aspects. First, to better model the h -level hierarchical label structure of the fine-grained image classes contained in the given training data set, we introduce h fully connected (fc) layers to replace the top fc layer of a given DCNN model and train them with the cascaded softmax loss. Second, we propose a novel loss function, namely, generalized large-margin (GLM) loss, to make the given DCNN model explicitly explore the hierarchical label structure and the similarity regularities of the fine-grained image classes. The GLM loss explicitly not only reduces between-class similarity and within-class variance of the learned features by DCNN models but also makes the subclasses belonging to the same coarse class be more similar to each other than those belonging to different coarse classes in the feature space. Moreover, the proposed fine-grained image classification framework is independent and can be applied to any DCNN structures. Comprehensive experimental evaluations of several general DCNN models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGG) using three benchmark data sets (Stanford car, fine-grained visual classification-aircraft, and CUB-200-2011) for the fine-grained image classification task demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

 abstract = {The latest generation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has achieved impressive results in the field of image classification. This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91{\%} and 98{\%}, for separate class tests, on average 96.3{\%}.},

@article{Teramoto.2017,
 abstract = {Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Currently, in differential diagnosis of lung cancer, accurate classification of cancer types (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma) is required. However, improving the accuracy and stability of diagnosis is challenging. In this study, we developed an automated classification scheme for lung cancers presented in microscopic images using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), which is a major deep learning technique. The DCNN used for classification consists of three convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. In evaluation experiments conducted, the DCNN was trained using our original database with a graphics processing unit. Microscopic images were first cropped and resampled to obtain images with resolution of 256 $\times$ 256 pixels and, to prevent overfitting, collected images were augmented via rotation, flipping, and filtering. The probabilities of three types of cancers were estimated using the developed scheme and its classification accuracy was evaluated using threefold cross validation. In the results obtained, approximately 71{\%} of the images were classified correctly, which is on par with the accuracy of cytotechnologists and pathologists. Thus, the developed scheme is useful for classification of lung cancers from microscopic images.},

When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.},

@article{Xie.2019,
 abstract = {Adversarial examples are commonly viewed as a threat to ConvNets. Here we present an opposite perspective: adversarial examples can be used to improve image recognition models if harnessed in the right manner. We propose AdvProp, an enhanced adversarial training scheme which treats adversarial examples as additional examples, to prevent overfitting. Key to our method is the usage of a separate auxiliary batch norm for adversarial examples, as they have different underlying distributions to normal examples.  We show that AdvProp improves a wide range of models on various image recognition tasks and performs better when the models are bigger. For instance, by applying AdvProp to the latest EfficientNet-B7 [28] on ImageNet, we achieve significant improvements on ImageNet (+0.7{\%}), ImageNet-C (+6.5{\%}), ImageNet-A (+7.0{\%}), Stylized-ImageNet (+4.8{\%}). With an enhanced EfficientNet-B8, our method achieves the state-of-the-art 85.5{\%} ImageNet top-1 accuracy without extra data. This result even surpasses the best model in [20] which is trained with 3.5B Instagram images ({\~{}}3000X more than ImageNet) and {\~{}}9.4X more parameters.

 abstract = {Classifying products precisely and efficiently is a major challenge in modern e-commerce. The high traffic of new products uploaded daily and the dynamic nature of the categories raise the need for machine learning models that can reduce the cost and time of human editors. In this paper, we propose a decision level fusion approach for multi-modal product classification based on text and image neural network classifiers. We train input specific state-of-the-art deep neural networks for each input source, show the potential of forging them together into a multi-modal architecture and train a novel policy network that learns to choose between them. Finally, we demonstrate that our multi-modal network improves classification accuracy over both networks on a real-world large-scale product classification dataset that we collected from Walmart.com. While we focus on image-text fusion that characterizes e-commerce businesses, our algorithms can be easily applied to other modalities such as audio, video, physical sensors, etc.},

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

@article{Zhang.2016,
 abstract = {Unsupervised learning and supervised learning are key research topics in deep learning. However, as high-capacity supervised neural networks trained with a large amount of labels have achieved remarkable success in many computer vision tasks, the availability of large-scale labeled images reduced the significance of unsupervised learning. Inspired by the recent trend toward revisiting the importance of unsupervised learning, we investigate joint supervised and unsupervised learning in a large-scale setting by augmenting existing neural networks with decoding pathways for reconstruction. First, we demonstrate that the intermediate activations of pretrained large-scale classification networks preserve almost all the information of input images except a portion of local spatial details. Then, by end-to-end training of the entire augmented architecture with the reconstructive objective, we show improvement of the network performance for supervised tasks. We evaluate several variants of autoencoders, including the recently proposed {\textquotedbl}what-where{\textquotedbl} autoencoder that uses the encoder pooling switches, to study the importance of the architecture design. Taking the 16-layer VGGNet trained under the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 protocol as a strong baseline for image classification, our methods improve the validation-set accuracy by a noticeable margin.},
